## Git Adventures

## Description
The user dropped into a maze created by the GitHub overlords. 
The Github overloads have left clues for the user but the player must be able to answer the ultimate
question before they will be able to get out.

## Gameplay
The user starts in a room where the overlord asks the player to enter a github user's name. The user then proceeds through the maze
to find the clues the player will need to answer the question. They can collect the clues but are losing health with every room
they move to. They must make it back to the entrance before their health runs out and correctly answer the overlords question.

## The items (clues)
The clues will be letters from the name of a repo project.

## Health
Health will start at 100 and decrease by x amount for every move.

## Win condition
The user will be presented a question that they should be able to answer with their clues and by browsing GitHub.

## Lose condition
The user runs out of health or they guess the answer to the question and get it wrong more than 3 times.
